# Git Branch Operation Command

This Git command step-by-step challenge is designed to teach you how to use the `branch`, `checkout`, and `merge` commands to manage branches in your Git repository. By following these steps, you will learn how to create a new branch, make changes to a file in the new branch, switch between branches using the checkout command, and merge changes from the new branch back into the main branch using the merge command.

## Skills

- `branch` -  Create, list, rename, and delete branches.
- `checkout` - Switch between different branches or restore working tree files.
- `merge` -  Merge branches into the current branch, thus merging the changes from two branches together
