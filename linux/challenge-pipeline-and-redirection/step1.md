Challenge: Using Logical Command to add three lines context to the example.txt.

## Introduction

In this Linux challenge, we will be creating a text file and manipulating its contents using logical, redirect, and pipeline commands. We will be using the shell to execute these commands.

## Target

Create a file named "example.txt" in the current directory. You need to create three lines of text in the file, which are "This is line 1. This is line 2. This is line 3."

## Result Example

The file should contain the following text:

```
This is line 1.
This is line 2.
This is line 3.
```

## Requirements

- Use the logical command to create the file and add the first line.
- Use the redirect command to add the second line to the file.
- Use the pipeline command to add the third line to the file.

## Summary

In this challenge, we have learned how to create a text file and manipulate its contents using logical, redirect, and pipeline commands. We have also created a shell script to detect whether the user has executed these commands.
