# Create a script to manipulate files using logical, redirect, and pipeline commands.

## Introduction

In this Linux challenge, we will create a script to manipulate files using logical, redirect, and pipeline commands. We will use the shell to execute these commands.

## Target

We will create a file named output.txt in the current directory. The file should contain the text "Hello, World!". We will then manipulate the file using the following commands:

Using a logical command, append the text "How are you?" to the end of the file.
Using a redirect command, overwrite the contents of the file with the text "Goodbye, World!".
Using a pipeline command, append the text "Nice to see you!" to the end of the file.

## Result Example

After executing the script, the output.txt file should contain the following text:

```
Goodbye, World!
Nice to see you!

```
## Requirements

- Use a logical command to create the file and add the text "Hello, World!" to it.
- Use a redirect command to overwrite the contents of the file with the text "Goodbye, World!".
- Use a pipeline command to append the text "Nice to see you!" to the end of the file.
